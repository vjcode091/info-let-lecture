            <h1>Lion</h1>
            <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. <br>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
                than females and have a prominent mane</p>
            <p><span>Speed:</span> 80 km/h (Maximum, In Short Bursts)<br>
                <span>Height:</span> 1.2 m (Male, Adult, At Shoulder), 90 – 110 cm (Female, Adult, At Shoulder)<br>
                <span>Lifespan:</span> 15 – 16 years (Female, Adult, In the wild), 8 – 10 years (Male, Adult, In the wild)<br>

            <p>Lions have few predators to fear other than humans. A very young or sickly lion might fall prey to hyenas. Cubs may be attacked and eaten by adult male lions. <br>Lions are most threatened by humans who hunt them and encroach on their habitat.</p>

            <h1>Tiger</h1>
            <p class="tiger1">The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. <br>It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer
                and wild boar.</p>
            <p class="tiger2">Tigers are the largest felines in the world and can reach up to 12.5 feet in length (including the tail) and up to 650 pounds. On their part, lions tend to weigh between 330 and 550 <br>kilos and measure between 6.5 and 11 feet. Interestingly,
                lions have longer tails than tigers.</p>
            <p>Tigers are the largest cat species in the world. Amur tigers (sometimes called Siberian tigers) are the biggest tigers, with males weighing up to 660 pounds and measuring up to 10 feet long from nose to tip of the tail.<br> Sumatran tigers
                are the smallest of the tiger subspecies, maxing out at about 310 pounds and 8 feet.</p>
