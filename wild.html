            <p class="lion_1">also this is just a project to test by webdesign skill, so let's dive into <span><i>Wild Info LET Lecture</i></span></p>
            <p class="lion_1">In this research, we are going to learn about the wild animals and their strength, speed, Lifespan e.t.c<br><span><i>Also it's going to be a fun research.</i></span></p>

            <h1>Lion</h1>
            <p class="lion_1">The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. <br>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
                than females and have a prominent mane</p>
            <p class="lion_1">Lions have few predators to fear other than humans. A very young or sickly lion might fall prey to hyenas. Cubs may be attacked and eaten by adult male lions. <br>Lions are most threatened by humans who hunt them and encroach on their habitat.</p>

        <section id="Tiger">
            <h1>Tiger</h1>
            <p class="animal_p">The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. <br>It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer
                and wild boar.</p>
            <p class="animal_p">Tigers are the largest felines in the world and can reach up to 12.5 feet in length (including the tail) and up to 650 pounds. On their part, lions tend to weigh between 330 and 550 <br>kilos and measure between 6.5 and 11 feet. Interestingly,
                lions have longer tails than tigers.</p>
            <p class="animal_p">Tigers are the largest cat species in the world. Amur tigers (sometimes called Siberian tigers) are the biggest tigers, with males weighing up to 660 pounds and measuring up to 10 feet long from nose to tip of the tail.<br> Sumatran tigers
                are the smallest of the tiger subspecies, maxing out at about 310 pounds and 8 feet.</p>

        <section id="Elephant">
            <h1>Elephant</h1>
            <p class="animal_p">Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: <br><span><i>the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.</i></span> They are the only surviving members of
                the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea.</p>
            <p class="animal_p">How to prevent Elephant attack:<br> <i>Throw a decoy object away from yourself to distract the elephant. If you're running and the elephant is drawing nearer, throw a jacket, hat, bag, or branch away from you. Try to toss the decoy at least 10
                feet (3.0 m). <br>This might serve as enough of a distraction for the elephant to attack it instead of you.</i></p>
            <p class="animal_p"><span>Gestation period:</span> Asian elephant: 18 – 22 months, African bush elephant: 22 months
                <br><span> Mass:</span> Asian elephant: 4,000 kg, African bush elephant: 6,000 kg, African forest elephant: 2,700 – 6,000 kg
